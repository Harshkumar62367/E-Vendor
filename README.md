### Idea behind <b>E-Vendor</b>:

During the Covid Crisis around the world especially in India, the lockdown period was a difficult one, and the shops when opened could be 
found with a huge rush which led to disobeying of "The Covid Guidelines".

Thinking about this problem, we introduced the idea of this touchless vending machine which only uses digital currency for payment purposes thereby reducing the chances of making contact with material surfaces or any other human touches during any purchases.

E-Vendor is a vending machine that runs on `NodeMCU`. 

For buying any froduct from E-Vendor you have to use its WebApp and buy the product of your choice and pay online. 
After the payment the vending machine serves your desired product to you.

### Idea behind <b>E-Vendor</b>:

During the Covid Crisis around the world especially in India, the lockdown period was a difficult one, and the shops when opened could be 
found with a huge rush which led to disobeying of "The Covid Guidelines".

Thinking about this problem, we introduced the idea of this touchless vending machine which only uses digital currency for payment purposes thereby reducing the chances of making contact with material surfaces or any other human touches during any purchases.


### How our E-Vendor works:

- First login in the E-Vendor console by entering your credentials.
- After completing first step you will be rewarded 50 coins in your WebApp wallet which you can use to buy certain items which are available in the vending machine.
- If the coins are sufficient enough to buy a certain item, the coins in your wallet will get deducted and the item will be given to the customer.
- Once a product dispatch is succesfull, the vending machine will produce a beep sound.
